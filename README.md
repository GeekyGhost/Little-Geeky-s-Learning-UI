   ```

4. Launch the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

#### 3. First-time Setup

When launching Little Geeky for the first time:

1. The application will create necessary directories for storing user data and models
2. For the speech synthesis to work properly:
   - **Kokoro TTS**: Will be installed with the requirements, but may need additional dependencies:
     - Windows: Visual C++ Redistributable might be required
     - Linux: Additional audio libraries might be needed (`libsndfile1`)
   - **System voices**: Will use your OS's available voices

#### 4. Model Setup in Ollama

For optimal performance, download these models in Ollama:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and run:
   ```
   # Basic model for text generation (choose one)
   ollama pull llama3
   
   # Vision model for document analysis (choose one)
   ollama pull llava
   ```

2. Within Little Geeky, go to the Settings tab â†’ Model Management to set up these models for different tasks

#### 5. Directory Structure

After installation, these directories will be created:

- `data/` - Stores user progress and settings
- `logs/` - Contains application logs for troubleshooting
- `models/` - Used for caching model information
- `temp/` - Temporary files for document processing

### System Requirements

- **Minimum**:
  - CPU: Dual-core processor
  - RAM: 4GB (8GB recommended if using large AI models)
  - Storage: 500MB for the application + space for models (models can range from 1GB to 8GB each)
  - Network: Not required after installation

  - CPU: Quad-core processor
  - RAM: 16GB or more
  - GPU: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (for faster AI processing)
  - Storage: SSD with at least 20GB free space

### Troubleshooting

- **Application doesn't start**:
  - Check Python version (`python --version`)
  - Ensure virtual environment is activated
  - Look at logs in the `logs/` directory

- **No AI responses**:
  - Verify Ollama is running in the background
  - Check models are downloaded in Ollama
  - Configure models in Settings tab

- **No audio output**:
  - Check system audio settings
  - Ensure audio libraries are installed
  - Try switching to system voices in the settings

- **Document processing issues**:
  - Ensure PyMuPDF is properly installed
  - Check if document is password protected
  - Verify file format is supported (PDF, PNG, JPG)

- **For log file access**:
  - Look in `logs/little_geeky.log` for detailed error messages
